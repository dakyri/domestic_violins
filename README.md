# domestic_violins

Custom software doing live sound process in the old power station for the
1997 Experimenta Festival in Melbourne.

Speakers and microphones were planted around a room decorated as a bright orange 70s kitchen.  A fridge contained coffee, a book of empty post-it notes,
and a message to "help yourself to the coffee".

Sound was gently reflected back and reprocessed, occasional samples of domestic activities were spat out, and the accumulated sound from the mics, were processed spectrally in real time via a genetic algorithm that was learning through the sound processing over the weeks duration of the installation. It's target: a spectrum of a sample from indian violinist Lalgudi Jayaram.

It never quite achieved domestic harmony, but it tried really really hard.
